# FF6PR2MSU (Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster to MSU-1)
FF6PR2MSU is a tool for Linux and Windows to take the .wav audio files from FF6PR and make them work with [Dizzy611](https://github.com/Dizzy611)'s [DancingMadFF6](https://github.com/Dizzy611/DancingMadFF6) MSU-1 hack.

### STILL A WORK IN PRORESS!
The application is incomplete, unoptimized, is untested on Windows, still requires a script to batch the operations and was put together in a day... As such, it might still be buggy and the code is in dire need of organizing and cleaning up.
<br /><br />
Right now, users will need to find a wav2msu executable or simply compile [jbaiter](https://github.com/jbaiter)'s [wav2msu](https://github.com/jbaiter/wav2msu). For Linux users, compiling it as an executable .out file seemed to work great.

## DISCLAIMER
I will <b><i>NOT</i></b> share the Pixel Remaster audio files themselves. The files are under copyright, thus sharing them around would be illegal. You will need to supply your own. To do so, I recommend you look around how to rip the audio resource files from the Steam release of the game.

## SET UP AND HOW TO USE
(WIP) ...Should be added shortly...

## CREDITS
This was made possible by the incredible work of user [Dizzy611](https://github.com/Dizzy611) on his tool [DancingMadFF6](https://github.com/Dizzy611/DancingMadFF6) which allows for MSU-1 streamed audio in FFIII and the [VGAudio](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio) library by user [Thealexbarney](https://github.com/Thealexbarney).
<br /><br />
FF6PR2MSU also requires the use of wav2msu, a tool to convert wave audio files to the PCM format used by the MSU-1. The original version of this tool was made by a user named Kawa whose page or original C# source code I could not find online... As such, I'll link you to [jbaiter](https://github.com/jbaiter)'s [reimplementation in C](https://github.com/jbaiter/wav2msu).

## FAQ
#### - I encountered an issue or a bug... what should I do?
Look up the [open issues](https://github.com/GoldenKain/FF6PR2MSU/issues). If it has already been reported, comment on it if you have any more information to add (this could make fixing it simpler and could get fixed sooner!). If it hasn't been reported, then I would greatly appreciate it if you could [create a new issue](https://github.com/GoldenKain/FF6PR2MSU/issues/new). :) <br />
