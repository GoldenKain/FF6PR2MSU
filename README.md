# FF6PR2MSU (Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster to MSU-1)

### STILL A WORK IN PRORESS!
The application is incomplete, unoptimized, is untested on Windows, still requires a script to batch the operations and was put together in a day... As such, it might still be buggy and the code is in dire need of organizing and cleaning up.

## SET UP AND HOW TO USE

## CREDITS
This was made possible by the incredible work of user @Dizzy611 on his tool DancingMadFF6 which allows for MSU-1 streamed audio in FFIII and the VGAudio library by user @Thealexbarney.<br />
